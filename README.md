# SimpleLLMusingLCEL
LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)
In this quickstart I'll show you how to build a simple LLM application with LangChain. This application will translate text from English into another language. This is a relatively simple LLM application - it's just a single LLM call plus some prompting. Still, this is a great way to get started with LangChain - a lot of features can be built with just some prompting and an LLM call!

- Using language models

- Using PromptTemplates and OutputParsers

- Using LangChain Expression Language (LCEL) to chain components together

- Debugging and tracing your application using LangSmith

- Deploying your application with LangServe
